## pie progress report

- pie:
    - got progress working on `requestIdleCallback`, processes the offset log into the sql database in spare cycles on Patchwork's main thread, Patchwork stays smooth
    - wrote a sql query which does backlinks, ripped out existing backlinks sbot plugin and it still works
        - if query happens before whole database is built, not all info is there but query still runs, can run again once database built with all the info
        - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X4b7GeRbLIL-lM1PujdSWqvHUIaUUG9v
    - last night spent time reading and engaging with alj's work on causal sorting, drawing pictures to understand, still wrapping head around it, trying to understand what we need to add in order to support casual sorting
        - link: %wtCU/eSLEGcIDvDeWDAajS0kzWgTaheOwKR8h9hNi+E=.sha256
    - also on mind, possible to add functions from rust to sql database, then use them in sql queries
        - two use cases:
            - causal sorting
            - storing content as cbor not json
- mat:
    - didn't realize alj wrote up on causal sorting, should check it out, as this has broken my brain before
    - sorting a thread helps traversing it
    - one idea i had is using sql float types to create a sequence of numbers and infinitely create smaller and smaller chunks to build up thread sequence numbers
        - as long as you receive messages in order, it's easy, but if you don't receive the messages in order you don't know what is branching off from what, you have messages in limbo
        - so you need to insert a message in between: a halfway float between two existing thread sequence numbers
    - thought about thread fragments, pending pieces of the thread
        - pie: mix has talked about this as "missing context"
            - i know this person posted this message before they saw the other message
        - mat: what's interesting is you can tell when they saw the other message
            - like git branch trees
        - mat: it's essentially a merge conflict, you put the message at the place in which they had the context
- pie:
    - just ran a query on links
        - in my db have 690k messages, 370k links between messages. 213k 

- pie: example sql:

```
SELECT messages.key AS id, author_id.author AS author, messages.received_time AS timestamp 
FROM messages, json_each(messages.branch)
JOIN links ON links.link_from=messages.key 
LEFT JOIN author_id ON author_id.id=messages.author_id 
WHERE links.link_to = :id
AND messages.received_time > :latestTimestamp 
AND NOT messages.content_type="about"
AND NOT messages.content_type="vote"
AND NOT messages.content_type="tag"
AND messages.root = :id
AND NOT (json_each.value IS NOT :id )
```

## how much money does mat need to survive?

- mik: was a question from the Buttshake Council meeting earlier today
- mat:
    - i have been living on 40k NZD this year
        - it's not enough to save much, but i can live a comfortable life
        - basically a living wage
    - when i was on 60k NZD, i felt super empowered, i didn't want more, it felt really good to be able to put away some each week
        - felt good to be able to spend 10k on Mangonui shack and solar panel

## real-time queries

- mat: we talked about this at Art~Hack and on Signal, would be good to talk here
- mat: I don't use branch for queries anywhere. It might be useful in causal sorting.
- mat: pie asked me at Art~Hack about real-time queries
    - the question came up, what do we need real-time queries for, can we come up with something simpler?
    - the answer was: we don't actually need real-time queries, we only need some way to invalidate things
        - the great thing about invalidation is that it doesn't need to be precise, it just needs to hint whether something might be invalidated
    - anytime the database adds a new message, we could invalidate all the observables on the screen, which would re-run the query and compare the new result with the old result, then only update if they diff
    - we need a new abstraction for our queries
        - an object that you can observe, is bound to an invalidation trigger, whenever the trigger runs, does the query again, checks if the result is the same or different, if different then emits that result as new state
    - pie: then we can use boring sql queries
    - mat: works for everything except feeds
        - currently feeds work by telling you how many invalidations were found
        - is it useful to know the exact number of messages
        - the key thing is it shouldn't say there are updates when nothing happens
        - my thinking was the invalidation would trigger a query to count how many invalidations there were
            - store the sequence since you last updated the feed, then query using that sequence, and count
        - then when you click the update button, it re-runs the query to get all the messages
    - i'm hacking around the pull-stream infrastructure to create the Patchwork we have, this would be closer to what i use
    - cut out the crap, make it simpler to reason about and implement, maybe slightly inefficent but probably negligible
    - one-to-ones and one-to-manys can have targeted invalidations, many-to-manys will need wide-spread invalidations
    - bringing us back to refreshing the web page, no more fancy updates like the new reddit where "no content available" later becomes content
