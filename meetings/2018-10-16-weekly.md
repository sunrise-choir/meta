## review

### Aljoscha

- full spec of legacy message format and metadata
    - includes edge cases of non-canonical formatting
    - oppressive amount of edge cases
- not everything is perfect and generalized
    - logical is right to generate test cases for fuzzer
    - once we generate a server executable, can figure out what needs to be improved
- read in data, validate it, output in compact format or signing format
    - hash computation: ssb didn't specify encoding, node defaulted to latin-1 encoding, in practice means encoding as utf-16 and taking only least significant bytes
- metadata
    - alj underestimated the protocol
    - defined multiformats
    - most annoying is how metadata itself is structured, serde is not good at parsing it
        - content can either be arbitary json object or string
        - serde cannot elegantly handle this case
        - solution is to ignore metadata as being json at all
- should we use custom-serde or serde
    - normal serde gives us potential for static traits for ssb message types
    - custom serde more accurately reflects the data model of ssb
- rust traits are less flexible than desired
    - ideal is serde parser can directly build up a native js object

        - https://docs.rs/napi-sys/0.1.1/napi_sys/enum.napi_valuetype.html
- testing & fuzzers
    - integration to rust toolchain, `cargo fuzz`
        - https://fuzz.rs/book/cargo-fuzz/setup.html
    - fuzzer analyzes paths to your code, tries to find the full state space of your implementation, tries all the fuzzy bits
    - test all the possible (corner) cases!
    - next step is to try all the possible cases in js
        - separate what is valid or invalid
    - creating great testing data sets

### piet

- first day, did setup, thinking about where to go
- jumped into making private-box-rs have usable js bindings
- as of yesterday, got js binding working
    - project is not as tidy as wanted
        -  faffed around with getting everything working
    - will have a think about using [`napi-sys`](https://docs.rs/crate/napi-sys/0.1.1) crate
- spent today looking at how everyone else manages prebuild binaries for things that need binaries
    - how does `cross` module work?
        - can we use his docker image? yikes rabbit hole
    - discovered appveyor 
    - use travis ci for building binaries
    - `trust` module: rust library for building rust bindings for many os's
        - japaric is fucking prolific and makes amazingly useful stuff
- looking at how to do async decryption
    - oh no, c++ void pointers and madness
    - will sleep and see how ugly the story is
- how to tidily manage when things go wrong
- overall happy with n-api, it's the thing we should be trying to use
    - only stable in node 10, but legit, is successor to nan
- tidy tidy tidy
- goal is to do a good job on this module
    - so will serve as a good easy-to-use template for other modules
- alj: is there a check whether a given string is a valid box?
    - wondering whether need to implement this higher up the stack
    - maybe good candidate for fuzzing

## what should alj do next?

- fun!

## what is the process for rust-js bindings

- `rust-sys` ?
    - probably the best way to go
    - pie will what he can do
- pie will write up a document on how to make rust-js bindings
