## attendees

## agenda

- [x] checkin
- [x] sunrise-choir / ssbrs
    - alj: like clear distinctions between specs and rust code
- [x] what aljoscha will start on this week?
- [x] how do we add new things and get @dominic's approval?
- [x] neon / n-api
- [x] async monads
- [x] reachability in the database
- [ ] plugins

## aljoscha start

- define the logical data model of ssb messages
- define rust traits / abstract apis for dealing with them
    - serde
- specify and implement legcay json encoding
- transitional codec for transport between servers
    - subset of cbor
    - should this be used for signing?
        - yay: json codec is ugly
        - nay: if we introduce a temporary format and use it to sign / hash messages, it will be around forever
- start an official ssb spec
    - a hard spec, less fluffy than protocol guide
    - able to drill into any part of the protocol and dive deep
    - not a linear document from start to end

## how many hours in a work day

- mikey: high trust hand-wave

## how to get approval

- recent plugin convo: %UyEnqEkxk2Sgl5467GRY1JyyWxYScWH+XhC9n4wsSEo=.sha256 
- mik: dominic is worried about us being all specs no code
    - maybe trying to nip a divergent spec in the bud
    - a perception where we create more work and not do the work
        - even if our perception disagrees
- mik: dominic likes negotiation
    - choose our battles
    - be clear about what is high priority
    - be willing to let go of what is not priority
- pie: how to explore the problem space without starting an argument
    - maybe make it explicit
- mik: swallow bits of javascript with native rust
- mik: good to build momentum and trust
- pie: get on a call with interested parties and make a case
    - alj: high-bandwidth conversations are not accessible
        - pie: still has value
        - pie: prioritize notes
    - alj: try to do as much as possible in text, not calls

## neon / n-api

neon looks stale

n-api looks promising

## async monads

context: %HjMfx1MFUqvLG+hA0ThYE5rssVFCVVuCBtP672cME7I=.sha256

- alj: rust has good generic interfaces
    - can test against the interfaces directly
    - macros for property-based testing of reader / writer
- alj: now rust supports afl fuzzer

## reachability

context: %uJX/grT0vK9opXvlmf0eQB+SCrpWirZRzkrCcCxmQU8=.sha256

- alj
    - is one thing older than another?
    - messages are nodes, cypherlinks are edges
    - is one node reachable by another node?
- mik
    - realized value of timestamps: "only fetch content from last month of messages"
    - keen for the best of both worlds
        - timestamps are human
        - but time is actually causation
