## Agenda

- checkins
- piet update
  - current benchmarks
    - what does this mean for bindings?
- mikey wants to find additional funding
    - after midway point, hopefully have visible momentum
    - keen to see if Dan and Zelf and SSB grant writers are keen to pitch on our behalf
    - Mikey is personally not convinced that SSB is going to succeed in finding much more grant funding, we've been lucky
        - we've also been declined from more potential funding
    - the Sunrise Choir was a way to be more attractive to funders: clear team and clear roadmap
    
## Actions

- Ask for expert help
    - Dominic?
    - Matt?
- learn if our binding approach is not being optimized
    - is our constructor monomorphic?
    - Try to see if profiler can tell if it it's de-optimised
