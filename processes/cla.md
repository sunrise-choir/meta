# Contributor License Agreement

To contribute to the Sunrise Choir, you must first sign a Contributor License Agreeement (CLA). :tophat:

## Why?

Mikey (@ahdinosaur), the steward of the Sunrise Choir, is committed to open source, and at the moment all the code is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 copyleft licence.

The Sunrise Choir intends to actively capture the value we create, so we can fund future open source development, rather than passively allow the value of our commons be extracted by others who aren't willing to reciprocate in sharing.

As such, the Contributor License Agreement is an experiment to “own” our copyright, so we have the flexibility to explore possible strategies like selling proprietary licenses to businesses profiting from our code or other such ways to capture the value we create, so maybe one day we can be financially sustainable (and not dependent on individual funding sources).

A Contributor License Agreement, as implemented here, allows contributors to grant a broad exclusive license to Mikey (@ahdinosaur), the steward of the Sunrise Choir. Until we have a proper legal entity with more decentralized governance, this means contributors trusting Mikey (@ahdinosaur) to steward their contribution’s copyright on behalf of the Sunrise Choir.

## How?
